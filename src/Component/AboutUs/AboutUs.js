            <h3>About Our Company</h3>
            <p>Follow Shake Shack’s lead and give your customers a doggie bag or some doggie treats with every meal. Shake Shack even have a special menu just for dogs, with ice creams and dog biscuits, right next to their normal menu. <br/>

            Almost always, people are crazy about their pets, and by showing your customers your softer side, you’ll talk to them on a powerful emotional level.</p>

            <p>Offer anyone with a competitor’s loyalty card (e.g. coffee card) and offer to trade it in for a free coffee at your restaurant. <br/>

            Firstly, you’ll take a loyal customer away from your competitor, and secondly, you just got your own loyal customer for the price of a coffee.</p>

            <p>What’s not to love about a mobile restaurant that’s also a traveling billboard for your restaurant? <br/>

            And that billboard also happens to come with smell-o-vision technology to attract customers from all around! <br/>

            Ultimately, it’s a great way to get your food around town and to people that wouldn’t normally come into your restaurant.</p>

            <p>We hear you – why on earth would you link up with another restaurant?

            Well, that restaurant likely has its own dedicated following that may not have heard of you. By doing something as simple as collaborating with them on a local dish, your reach on social media now includes their audience.

            It’s a restaurant promotion idea that’s a win-win for all involved.</p>
